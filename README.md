# Local-Storage-Exercise-with-JS
In this project, its data can be kept in local storage.
I tested keeping the last value of the increment and decrement counter in local storage. Even when you refresh the page, you can increase or decrease from where you left off because the last value you increased is saved in localstorage.

The counter, which is in this state at the beginning, updates the value in the local storage after each increase and decrease.
